Feature: Updates to the Send Love Form

	Scenario: The user will be able to enter data in 5 USER CUSTOMIZED fields in addition to their email address and personal message

Given I am a user navigated to the home page
When I click on the "Talk to Us" button from the header navigation bar
Then I see a form with 5 USER CUSTOIMIZED text fields, an email address field, a free-text message field, and a "Send Love" button
